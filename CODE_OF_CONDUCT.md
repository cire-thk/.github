# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject 
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not 
aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor 
for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

In addition, the `Anti-discrimination Regulation of Cologne University of Applied Sciences (TH Köln)` and the
`Regulation for Dealing with Sexualised Discrimination and Violence at the Cologne University of Applied Sciences (TH Köln)`
apply in case employees or students experience or are responsible for harassment or discrimination. 
The orders can be found [here](https://www.th-koeln.de/mam/downloads/deutsch/hochschule/amtlichemitteilungen/endfassung_25_2024.pdf) 
and [here](https://www.th-koeln.de/mam/downloads/deutsch/hochschule/amtlichemitteilungen/2020/endfassung_05_2020_final.pdf) (both in German).
If you have experienced or witnessed misconduct, you can contact the official contact points listed in the above regulations.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.
